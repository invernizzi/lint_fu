Finish plugin architecture - only load the plugins that apply to a specific project dir

Create a Cucumber feature suite
  * SQL injection
  * Buggy eager load
  * Suppression/blessing

Create Core and Report modules

Unify the "bless" and "suppress" features
  * make them live in the same place (Checker?)
  * allow for suppression in any scope (class/module/method), not just class
